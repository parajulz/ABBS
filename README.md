ABBS - A’s Before BaeS

App Domain:
Education, Productivity, Social, Networking

Description of App:
**ABBS** is a fullstack professional social networking IOS app that helps UC Berkeley students find compatible **study partners** — not dates — based on shared classes, study habits, and academic goals. Designed with a swipe-based interface inspired by dating apps like Hinge, ABBS turns social matching into productive academic connections.

They can set filters and find matches reading other student’s profiles. 

Outside Factors:
Similar applications like Hinge and Tinder focus on romantic matchmaking, while ABBS' matchmaking style algorithm inspired from dating apps is a lot more engaging, fun, and easy! People can filter their own preferences and find study partners by simply reading their profile and clicking heart or x. This way, they can connect to other students faster.
Matching algorithm is based on learning compatibility, not just course overlap.
